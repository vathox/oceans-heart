strength.

GUARD CAPTAIN:
Of course! What do you think it took for you
to have the guts to fight through ten brutes
and then demand we stop working for our

steady employer? INNER STRENGTH!
That's the new outer strength.  All my guys
can lift boulders, but they wouldn't stand up
GUARD CAPTAIN:
to me. Or try to undermine the head of the
Merchants' Guild. You say he's having us
enforce unfair contracts? Well, I don't want
GUARD CAPTAIN:
to be the bad guy. Look, if you're strong
enough to defeat like all my guys, stand up
to me and the Guild, you're the strongest.
GUARD CAPTAIN:
You're the captain now. We'll take our
orders from you.

TILIA:
I don't really want to be your captain.


VICE CAPTAIN:
Too late, captain! We'll stop enforcing the
unfair contracts!

My family runs a tavern back at home- if the

fill the next batch with sleeping potion or
something and sneak right into the fort.

Huh, that's not actually a bad plan. Alright,
I'll do some asking around and see if I can
find out where their booze comes from. You
